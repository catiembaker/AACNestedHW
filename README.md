 This repository implements an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system, allowing users to associate images with corresponding text to facilitate communication. It includes classes for managing categories, images, and their mappings.


 ## Resources Used

- **Official Java Documentation**: I extensively consulted the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) to gain clarity on the usage of specific Java methods and classes. This was particularly helpful in understanding how to work with strings, characters, and arrays in Java.
- **StackOverflow**: In instances where I encountered challenges during coding, such as determining the length of user input or implementing certain mathematical aspects related to AAC devices, I sought solutions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This platform provided valuable examples and insights.
- **Java Style Guide**: To maintain consistent formatting and adhere to naming conventions, I followed the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). This practice contributes to improved code readability and maintainability.
- **Markdown Guide**: The structure and content of this README.md file were crafted using an [online Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). This resource offered guidance on Markdown syntax, enabling effective documentation for the Augmentive and Alternative Communication Devices project.
